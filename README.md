# hello-world
First github work...

I am new to programming. I have recently completed an introductory Java course and a more advanced Python course with NumPy and Pandas. I hope to learn as much as possible and become a well rounded, full stack developer eventually. I want to start my own projects and hopefully find a job. My experience will grow from there.
